# Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of various classic algorithms in JavaScript and python. It's perfect for practicing and having different search and sorting techniques at hand.

## Contents

- **Search**
  - `BusquedaBinaria.js`: Implementation of the binary search algorithm.
  
- **Sort**
  - `insertSort.js`: Implementation of the insertion sort algorithm.
  - `margesort.js`: Implementation of the merge sort algorithm.
  - `quickSort.js`: Implementation of the quicksort algorithm.
  
- **Other files**
  - `tareas.js`: File with examples related to task algorithms.
  - `text.txt`: Example text file.

## Usage

Each file contains its own implementation and can be run independently to understand its functionality. To execute the sorting or searching examples, simply run the corresponding JavaScript file using a JavaScript runtime environment.
